### 2. **Installation (INSTALLATION.md)**

The **Installation** section provides instructions for setting up and installing the project locally so users can run, test, or contribute to it. 
This is crucial for any project that requires specific steps or dependencies to get it working.

An **`INSTALLATION.md`** file typically contains:

- **Prerequisites**: Any software or tools that need to be installed beforehand (like Node.js, Python, Docker, etc.).
- **Install steps**: Detailed instructions for installing and setting up the project.
- **Dependencies**: Instructions to install dependencies or libraries required to run the project.
- **Running the project**: How to run the project after installation (e.g., commands to start the application).
- **Optional steps**: Any additional setup or configuration needed for the project.
